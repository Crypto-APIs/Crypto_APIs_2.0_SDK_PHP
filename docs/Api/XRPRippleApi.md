## `getLatestMinedXRPRippleBlock()`

```php
getLatestMinedXRPRippleBlock($network, $context): \CryptoAPIs\Model\GetLatestMinedXRPRippleBlockR
```

Get Latest Mined XRP (Ripple) Block

Through this endpoint customers can fetch the last mined XRP block in the blockchain, along with its details. These could include the hash of the specific, the previous and the next block, its transactions count, its height, etc.     Since XRP is a different blockchain than Bitcoin and Ethereum, it isn't unified.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('x-api-key', 'Bearer');


$apiInstance = new CryptoAPIs\Api\XRPRippleApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$network = testnet; // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
$context = 'context_example'; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getLatestMinedXRPRippleBlock($network, $context);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {

## `getXRPRippleAddressDetails()`

```php
getXRPRippleAddressDetails($network, $address, $context): \CryptoAPIs\Model\GetXRPRippleAddressDetailsR
```

Get XRP (Ripple) Address Details

Through this endpoint the customer can receive basic information about a given XRP address based on confirmed/synced blocks only. In the case where there are any incoming or outgoing **unconfirmed** transactions for the specific address, they **will not** be counted or calculated here.    Since XRP is a different blockchain than Bitcoin and Ethereum, it isn't unified.
