List Unconfirmed Omni Transactions By Property ID

This endpoint will list unconfirmed Omni transactions by an attribute `propertyId`. The transactions listed will detail additional information such as hash, height, time of creation in Unix timestamp, etc.    Unconfirmed transactions are usually put in the Mempool and await verification so that they can be added to a block.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('x-api-key', 'Bearer');


$apiInstance = new CryptoAPIs\Api\OmniLayerApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$network = testnet; // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
$blockchain = bitcoin; // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
$property_id = 2; // string | Represents the identifier of the tokens to send.
$context = 'context_example'; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
$limit = 50; // int | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis.
$offset = 10; // int | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->listUnconfirmedOmniTransactionsByPropertyID($network, $blockchain, $property_id, $context, $limit, $offset);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling OmniLayerApi->listUnconfirmedOmniTransactionsByPropertyID: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```
