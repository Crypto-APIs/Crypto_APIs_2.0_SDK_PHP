## `createAutomaticCoinsForwarding()`

```php
createAutomaticCoinsForwarding($blockchain, $network, $context, $create_automatic_coins_forwarding_rb): \CryptoAPIs\Model\CreateAutomaticCoinsForwardingR
```

Create Automatic Coins Forwarding

Through this endpoint customers can set up an automatic forwarding function specifically for coins (**not** tokens). They can have a `toAddress` which is essentially the main address and the destination for the automatic coins forwarding.     There is also a `minimumTransferAmount` which only when reached will then trigger the forwarding. Through this the customer can save from fees.    Moreover, `feePriority` can be also set,  which defines how quickly to move the coins once they are received. The higher priority, the larger the fee will be. It can be \"SLOW\", \"STANDARD\" or \"FAST\".    The response of this endpoint contains an attribute `fromAddress` which can be used as a deposit address. Any funds received by this address will be automatically forwarded to `toAddress` based on what the customer has set for the automation.    For this automatic forwarding the customer can set a callback subscription.    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted. There is no need to do that for every transaction.{/warning}    {note}This endpoint generates a new `fromAddress` each time.{/note}

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('x-api-key', 'Bearer');


$apiInstance = new CryptoAPIs\Api\AutomaticCoinsForwardingApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$blockchain = bitcoin; // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
$network = testnet; // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
$context = 'context_example'; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
$create_automatic_coins_forwarding_rb = new \CryptoAPIs\Model\CreateAutomaticCoinsForwardingRB(); // \CryptoAPIs\Model\CreateAutomaticCoinsForwardingRB

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->createAutomaticCoinsForwarding($blockchain, $network, $context, $create_automatic_coins_forwarding_rb);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling AutomaticCoinsForwardingApi->createAutomaticCoinsForwarding: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;

## `deleteAutomaticCoinsForwarding()`

```php

Delete Automatic Coins Forwarding

Through this endpoint customers can delete a forwarding function they have set for **coins** (**not** tokens).    By setting a `fromAddress` and a `toAddress`, and specifying the amount, coins can be transferred between addresses.     A `feePriority` will be returned which represents the fee priority of the automation whether it is \"SLOW\", \"STANDARD\" OR \"FAST\".    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted. There is no need to do that for every transaction.{/warning}
