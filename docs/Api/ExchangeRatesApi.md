## `getExchangeRateByAssetSymbols()`

```php
getExchangeRateByAssetSymbols($from_asset_symbol, $to_asset_symbol, $context, $calculation_timestamp): \CryptoAPIs\Model\GetExchangeRateByAssetSymbolsR
```

Get Exchange Rate By Asset Symbols

Through this endpoint customers can obtain exchange rates by asset symbols. The process represents the exchange rate value of a single unit of one asset versus another one. Data is provided per unique asset symbol.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('x-api-key', 'Bearer');


$apiInstance = new CryptoAPIs\Api\ExchangeRatesApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$from_asset_symbol = btc; // string | Defines the base asset symbol to get a rate for.
$to_asset_symbol = usd; // string | Defines the relation asset symbol in which the base asset rate will be displayed.
$context = 'context_example'; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
$calculation_timestamp = 1618577849; // int | Defines the time of the market data used to calculate the exchange rate in UNIX Timestamp.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getExchangeRateByAssetSymbols($from_asset_symbol, $to_asset_symbol, $context, $calculation_timestamp);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling ExchangeRatesApi->getExchangeRateByAssetSymbols: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

## `getExchangeRateByAssetsIDs()`

```php
getExchangeRateByAssetsIDs($from_asset_id, $to_asset_id, $context, $calculation_timestamp): \CryptoAPIs\Model\GetExchangeRateByAssetsIDsR
```

Get Exchange Rate By Assets IDs

Through this endpoint customers can obtain exchange rates by asset IDs. The process represents the exchange rate value of a single unit of one asset versus another one. Data is provided per unique asset Reference ID.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$from_asset_id = 5b1ea92e584bf50020130612; // string | Defines the base asset Reference ID to get a rate for.
$to_asset_id = 5b1ea92e584bf50020130615; // string | Defines the relation asset Reference ID in which the base asset rate will be displayed.
$context = 'context_example'; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
$calculation_timestamp = 1618577849; // int | Defines the time of the market data used to calculate the exchange rate in UNIX Timestamp.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getExchangeRateByAssetsIDs($from_asset_id, $to_asset_id, $context, $calculation_timestamp);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
