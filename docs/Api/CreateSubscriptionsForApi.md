## `minedTransaction()`

```php
minedTransaction($blockchain, $network, $context, $mined_transaction_rb): \CryptoAPIs\Model\MinedTransactionR
```

Mined transaction

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when a specific transaction is mined. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified `transactionId`.    A transaction is mined when it is included in a new block in the blockchain.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn't happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('x-api-key', 'Bearer');


$apiInstance = new CryptoAPIs\Api\CreateSubscriptionsForApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$blockchain = bitcoin; // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
$network = testnet; // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
$context = 'context_example'; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.

} catch (Exception $e) {

New Block

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when a new block is mined in the specific blockchain. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.    A new block is mined when it is added to the chain once a consensus is reached by the majority of the miners, which is when the block gets validated and added to the blockchain.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL.

## `newConfirmedTokensTransactionsAndEachConfirmation()`

```php
newConfirmedTokensTransactionsAndEachConfirmation($blockchain, $network, $context, $new_confirmed_tokens_transactions_and_each_confirmation_rb): \CryptoAPIs\Model\NewConfirmedTokensTransactionsAndEachConfirmationR
```

New confirmed tokens transactions and each confirmation

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when there are new incoming or outgoing confirmed transactions for tokens from/to the customer's address with also a response at each confirmation the transaction has received until the specified confirmations limit is reached. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.     Being confirmed means that the transactions are verified by miners and added to the next block. This endpoint refers to **tokens transactions only, not coins**.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn't happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}

### Example

```php
<?php

// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');

$apiInstance = new CryptoAPIs\Api\CreateSubscriptionsForApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),

$blockchain = bitcoin; // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.

## `newUnconfirmedCoinsTransactions()`

```php

```

New unconfirmed coins transactions

Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when there are new unconfirmed coins transactions for the user. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.    Unconfirmed coins transactions remain in the mempool (memory pool) until they are confirmed by miners and added to the next block. Sometimes spikes in transaction activity can cause delays in confirmations.    {warning}We cannot guarantee at 100% that webhooks for unconfirmed transactions will always be received. Some may **not get received** due to the possibility of some nodes not being updated with that information. This can occur in networks with low activity and/or not many nodes, e.g. Testnet networks and rarely Mainnets.{/warning}    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {note}It is also **important to note** that just because pending unconfirmed transactions are in the mempool, **doesn't necessarily** mean they will get confirmed.{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs.
