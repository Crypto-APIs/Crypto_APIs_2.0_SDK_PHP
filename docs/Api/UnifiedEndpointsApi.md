## `getAddressDetails()`

```php
getAddressDetails($blockchain, $network, $address, $context): \CryptoAPIs\Model\GetAddressDetailsR
```

Get Address Details

Through this endpoint the customer can receive basic information about a given address based on confirmed/synced blocks only. In the case where there are any incoming or outgoing **unconfirmed** transactions for the specific address, they **will not** be counted or calculated here.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('x-api-key', 'Bearer');


$apiInstance = new CryptoAPIs\Api\UnifiedEndpointsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$blockchain = bitcoin; // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
$network = testnet; // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
$address = mzYijhgmzZrmuB7wBDazRKirnChKyow4M3; // string | Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key.
$context = 'context_example'; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getAddressDetails($blockchain, $network, $address, $context);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **blockchain** | **string**| Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc. |
 **network** | **string**| Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \&quot;mainnet\&quot; is the live network with actual data while networks like \&quot;testnet\&quot;, \&quot;ropsten\&quot;, \&quot;rinkeby\&quot; are test networks. |
 **block_hash** | **string**| Represents the hash of the block, which is its unique identifier. It represents a cryptographic digital fingerprint made by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm. |
 **context** | **string**| In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. &#x60;context&#x60; is specified by the user. | [optional]
 **limit** | **int**| Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. | [optional] [default to 50]
 **offset** | **int**| The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items. | [optional] [default to 0]

### Return type

## `listTransactionsByBlockHeight()`

```php
listTransactionsByBlockHeight($blockchain, $network, $height, $context, $limit, $offset): \CryptoAPIs\Model\ListTransactionsByBlockHeightR
```

List Transactions by Block Height

This endpoint will list transactions by an attribute `blockHeight`. The transactions listed will detail additional information such as hash, addresses, time of creation in Unix timestamp, etc.    {note}Please note that listing data from the same type will apply pagination on the results.{/note}

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('x-api-key', 'Bearer');


$apiInstance = new CryptoAPIs\Api\UnifiedEndpointsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$blockchain = bitcoin; // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
$network = testnet; // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
$height = 673852; // int | Represents the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding this specific block. Block numbers have no gaps. A blockchain usually starts with block 0 called the \"Genesis block\".
$context = 'context_example'; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
$limit = 50; // int | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis.
$offset = 10; // int | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->listTransactionsByBlockHeight($blockchain, $network, $height, $context, $limit, $offset);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling UnifiedEndpointsApi->listTransactionsByBlockHeight: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
