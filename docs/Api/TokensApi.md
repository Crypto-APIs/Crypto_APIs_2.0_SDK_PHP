## `getTokenDetailsByContractAddress()`

```php
getTokenDetailsByContractAddress($blockchain, $network, $contract_address, $context): \CryptoAPIs\Model\GetTokenDetailsByContractAddressR
```

Get Token Details by Contract Address

Though this endpoint customers can obtain information about token details. This can be done by providing the `contact address` parameter.    {note}This address is **not** the same as the smart contract creator address.{/note}

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
$config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKey('x-api-key', 'YOUR_API_KEY');
// Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
// $config = CryptoAPIs\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setApiKeyPrefix('x-api-key', 'Bearer');


$apiInstance = new CryptoAPIs\Api\TokensApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$blockchain = ethereum; // string | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
$network = ropsten; // string | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
$contract_address = 0x7495fede000c8a3b77eeae09cf70fa94cd2d53f5; // string | Defines the specific address of the contract.
$context = 'context_example'; // string | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getTokenDetailsByContractAddress($blockchain, $network, $contract_address, $context);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling TokensApi->getTokenDetailsByContractAddress: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```
