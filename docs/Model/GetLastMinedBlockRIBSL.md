------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**difficulty** | **string** | Represents a mathematical value of how hard it is to find a valid hash for this block. |
**nonce** | **string** | Represents a random value that can be adjusted to satisfy the proof of work |
**size** | **int** | Represents the total size of the block in Bytes. |
**bits** | **string** | Represents a specific sub-unit of Litecoin. Bits have two-decimal precision. |
**chainwork** | **string** | Represents a hexadecimal number of all the hashes necessary to produce the current chain. E.g., when converting 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000086859f7a841475b236fd to a decimal you get 635262017308958427068157 hashes, or 635262 exahashes. |
