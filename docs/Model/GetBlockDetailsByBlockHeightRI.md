# # GetBlockDetailsByBlockHeightRI

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**hash** | **string** | Represents the hash of the block, which is its unique identifier. It represents a cryptographic digital fingerprint made by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm. |
**height** | **int** | Represents the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding this specific block. Block numbers have no gaps. A blockchain usually starts with block 0 called the \&quot;Genesis block\&quot;. |
**next_block_hash** | **string** | Represents the hash of the next block. When this is the last block of the blockchain this value will be an empty string. |
**previous_block_hash** | **string** | Represents the hash of the previous block, also known as the parent block. |
**timestamp** | **int** | Defines the exact date/time when this block was mined in Unix |
**transactions_count** | **int** | Represents the total number of all transactions as part of this block. |
**blockchain_specific** | [**\CryptoAPIs\Model\GetBlockDetailsByBlockHeightRIBS**](GetBlockDetailsByBlockHeightRIBS.md) |  |
